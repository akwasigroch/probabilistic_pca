# Probabilistic PCA
##
My implementation of probabilistic PCA based on "Pattern recognition and machine learning" book by C. Bishop.

The probabilistc_PCA_mnist.ipynb file contains implementation of PPCA algorithm using both closed-form solution and iterative Expectation Maximization solution.

The algorithms are for educational purpose only. In your work use more efficient implementation e.g. from scikit-learn package.

## Dependencies
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
